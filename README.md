This is a biophysically realistic single neuron model based on papers by [Shouval 2002](www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.152343099) and [Yeung 2004](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0405555101).

It was implemented as part of my [Bachelor's thesis](https://pungas.ee/files/BSc_thesis.pdf) in Computer Science at University of Tartu, supervised by Raul Vicente and Jaan Aru.
