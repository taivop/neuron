%% Step 2: How much do correlations change the distribution when means are
% assumed to be equal?

fprintf('\nStep 2: Effect of correlations\n\n')
fprintf('Computing...\n')

% First, we generate a mean vector in ten dimensions. We assume that all
% means are approximately .5, but we add some Gaussian noise to the network
% is not to uniform. We set the covariances so that the resulting
% correlations are sizable, but not to large (~0.1). 

mu = ones(10,1) * .2 + randn(10,1)*0.05;
v = mu.*(1-mu);
C = ones(10,10) * .02;
C(eye(size(C))==1) = v;

% We find the histogram of the independent distribution with this mean
% vector P(x) = PROD_i P(X_i=1) and the DG distribution with the same mean
% and the covariances as defined above.

h1 = binHistIndep(mu);    % returns the histogram of an independet distribution
S = sampleDichGauss01(mu,C,1e5);
h2 = binHist(S);          % creates a histogram of the binary patterns in S
h2 = h2 / sum(h2);

% When we compare them, we see that some patterns occur much more often 
% in the correlated then in the independent distribution. This a clear
% indication of the strength of the correlations. The "stripes" coincide
% with patterns with a different number of active neurons (starting at 0 in
% the upper left corner).

%% Step 3: Correlated Poisson from a binary process (3.1)
% First, we generate samples from a correlated Poisson distribution with
% specified mean and covariance matrix. The covariance between the two
% distributions is positive and quite strong. The construction follows the
% description in section 3.1, i.e. we first find a binary process with the
% correct parameters and sum over it. This means we create
% a joint Poisson distribution.
